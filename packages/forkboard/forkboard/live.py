"""The live page: published as an artifact that saves itself, people keep their own versions and ask questions.

The page (index.html) stays fixed; what people do lands in state.json beside it, which the page saves with the
artifact's own publish. Each person saves their own version of a diagram, keyed by their id; the original is the
document's diagram; asks are questions for the session, which answers them and publishes again.

    state.json = {"feature", "round",
                  "figures": {"<n>": {"title", "source", "original": graph,
                                      "versions": {"<person id>": {"graph", "pos", "at", "via"}}}},
                  "asks": [{"by", "at", "figure", "version", "text", "answer"}]}

The n-th figure is the n-th mermaid diagram in the document, counted from 1, as on the page. "feature" is the
document's id (the name is kept so pages published before forkboard still load). "source" is a fingerprint of the
diagram the page was built from, so a tool that writes a version back can see that its source changed since.
