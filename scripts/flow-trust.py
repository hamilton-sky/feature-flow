"""The trusted check in front of every conductor call.

usage: FLOW_TRUST=<last TRUST digest | new> FLOW_SESSION=<token> python3 -I scripts/flow-trust.py [--after-build <ticket> <sha>] <feature> <command> [args...]

It hashes the flow's own files (the conductor, its package, guides, roles, skills and the run
state), refuses to call the conductor when they differ from the digest the session passed in
FLOW_TRUST, runs the conductor, and prints `TRUST <digest>` for the session to pass next time.
It stops when the flow's code changed during the call, or when the run state is not what the
conductor reported saving. After a BUILD, `--after-build <ticket> <sha>` accepts a code change
(never a state change) when the ticket at <sha> has `Floor: allow flow-edit`.

It imports nothing from the repo, on purpose: it is the code that decides whether the flow's
files on disk were changed, so it must not run any of them. The skill's loader checks this
file's sha256 against the hash pinned in the skill and runs those same bytes with `exec`, so
nothing a subagent can write decides the check. Standard library only, Python 3.9+.
