"""feature-flow report <feature>: what a run did, read from its log.

usage: feature-flow report <feature>
Reads .feature-flow/state/flow-<feature>.log (one `time,ticket,EVENT` line per step) and prints, per
ticket, how many times it was built and reviewed and which checks failed, then the run's STOPs, resets
and handoffs. Read-only. It cannot see a trust-runner STOP (the runner stops before the conductor
logs anything): the session's own output shows those, so count them by hand.
