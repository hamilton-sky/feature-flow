"""The installer, ported from install.sh with the same report and exit codes.

usage: python3 install.py [target-repo] [--agent claude|codex|all] [--user] [--private] [--force] [--dry-run]
copies the feature-flow skill, its roles, scripts and guides into a repo so the flow works there.
a file that already exists and differs is kept and reported, unless --force is given or nobody
edited it since an earlier feature-flow install wrote it (then it is updated).
nothing is ever deleted. --user installs for every repo and writes nothing into one: the skills and
roles go to ~/.claude and ~/.agents, the scripts, guides, roles and Python package to ~/.feature-flow.
CLAUDE_HOME overrides ~/.claude, AGENTS_HOME ~/.agents and FEATURE_FLOW_HOME ~/.feature-flow for --user.

Files are compared and written as bytes, and the two text transforms (the Codex skill header and
a role file without its frontmatter) follow the awk programs of the bash version line for line,
so the installed tree is the same byte for byte. Files are listed in byte order, as `sort` does
with LC_ALL=C.
