"""The Workspace a phase works in: the main worktree, lane k, or the integration worktree that `integrate`
merges in. It holds the folder, the state view (the run's keys plain, a lane's keys as `L<k>.<key>`), the lane
number (0 outside lanes) and the repo top, and the per-ticket steps that read them. Phases, schedulers, guards
and build checks read the state, the lane and the lane word from the Workspace they are handed.

The Conductor is the main worktree's Workspace: one ticket at a time, the run-wide phases and the facade's own
commands work on it. A lane's or the integration worktree's Workspace is its own object over the Conductor:
what it does not hold itself (the settings, the paths, the scheduler, the whole run state) comes from there.
