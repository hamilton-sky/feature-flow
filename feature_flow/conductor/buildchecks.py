"""The checks of a build as an ordered pipeline: the gate, the floor guard, the footprint, Done when and test first.

Each check's `run(c)` takes the conductor (for its paths, settings, state and log) and returns
(failure source, report, notes): source is None when it passes, and the notes are for the reviewer.
`run` stops at the first failure. `pipeline` picks the checks of a build as the conductor always has:
the gate only with the gate on (a batch leaves it out: its gate runs once at HEAD), Done when and test
first only with the gate on.
